    <p>Make a perfect, protein-rich brunch or breakfast for two people. This healthy omelette can be on the table in just 10 minutes, served with juicy tomatoes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chopped parsley</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chopped basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a small non-stick frying pan, then cook the tomatoes cut-side down until starting to soften and colour. Meanwhile, beat the eggs with the herbs and plenty of freshly ground black pepper in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Scoop the tomatoes from the pan and put them on two serving plates. Pour the egg mixture into the pan and stir gently with a wooden spoon so the egg that sets on the base of the pan moves to enable uncooked egg to flow into the space. Stop stirring when itâ€™s nearly cooked to allow it to set into an omelette. Cut into four and serve with the tomatoes.</li>
    </ol>
