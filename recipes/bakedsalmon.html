            <li>1 tbsp olive oil or melted butter</li>
            <li>chopped herbs, lemon slices and steamed long-stem broccoli, to serve (optional)</li>

            <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Brush each salmon fillet with the oil or butter and season well.</li>
            <li>Put the salmon fillets in an ovenproof dish. Cover if you prefer your salmon to be tender, or leave uncovered if you want the flesh to roast slightly.</li>
            <li>Roast for 10-15 mins (or about 4 mins per 1cm thickness) until just opaque and easily flaked with a fork. Serve with a sprinkling of chopped herbs, lemon slices and steamed long-stem broccoli, if you like.</li>
